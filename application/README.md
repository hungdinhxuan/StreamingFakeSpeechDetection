## Building

To build this app, run **gradle assembleRelease**

To sign the build, first generate your keystore with `keytool -genkeypair -keystore mykey.keystore -validity 365000 -keysize 4096 -keyalg RSA` and place it in this folder under `signature.keystore` name.
(**Note**: Run keytool with the same or older Java version on which you are going to build the application)

Then you can run **quicksign.bash** with path to your Android SDK "build-tools/*version*" as an *optional* argument(if build tools aren't in your $PATH).

Example: `./quicksign.bash $ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/33.0.0`


## ! Urgent !

I don't currently accept any donations for DroidRec, but I'm asking you to:
